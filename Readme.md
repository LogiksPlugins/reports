Logiks Reporting Plugin
=======================

# Overview
The Reporting Module was designed to provide a feature-rich, user-friendly UI for managing and administrating reports within Logiks. In addition, the Reporting Module provides a flexible and extensible API that module developers can use to build their own reports and tools. The core idea behind the Reporting Module is to provide a complete system for most of the practical needs of developers and advanced users.

We encourage all Logiks users and developers to download the reporting module, use it frequently, create new tickets for bug fixes and feature requests, and provide feedback.
